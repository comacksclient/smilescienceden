    question: "Do you accept dental insurance?",

  },
    {
    question: "How often should I get a dental cleaning?",
    answer: "We recommend a professional teeth cleaning every 6 months to prevent cavities, gum disease, and tartar buildup. Patients with sensitive gums or a history of gum infections may need more frequent cleanings. Regular cleanings help maintain long-term oral health."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do if I have a dental emergency?",
    answer: "If you experience severe tooth pain, swelling, bleeding, a knocked-out tooth, or a broken crown, contact us immediately. We offer same-day emergency dental appointments in Electronic City for quick relief and treatment."
  },
  {
    question: "Are teeth whitening treatments safe?",

  },
  {
    question: "How long do dental crowns and bridges last?",
    answer: "With proper oral hygiene, our zirconia and ceramic crowns can last 10–15 years or more. We guide you on care routines to extend their lifespan. Regular checkups help ensure your crown or bridge stays intact and functional."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I fix gaps or crooked teeth without braces?",
    answer: "Yes. We offer clear aligners, cosmetic bonding, and veneers to correct gaps and misalignments without metal braces. During your consultation, we evaluate your smile and suggest the best solution based on your dental structure and goals."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer smile makeover treatments?",
    answer: "Yes. Our smile makeover services include veneers, crowns, whitening, gum contouring, and digital smile designing. This allows you to preview your new smile before starting treatment, ensuring predictable results."
  },
  {
    question: "Is teeth sensitivity treatable?",
    answer: "Yes. Sensitivity is commonly caused by enamel wear, gum recession, or cavities. We diagnose the root cause and provide treatments like desensitizing agents, fluoride therapy, bonding, or gum coverage procedures to eliminate sensitivity."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know which dental treatment is right for me?",
    answer: "We provide a thorough oral examination using digital X-rays, intraoral cameras, and diagnostic tools. Based on your oral condition, lifestyle, and goals, we create a personalized treatment plan tailored to your needs."
